About this project:
This project is a simplified version of the bash takes commands from the
keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
It is created using the C programming language and adapts many of the functionalities a real shell has.

Essential functionalities of the simple shell:
Displays a prompt "#cisfun$ " and waits for user input.
Runs all commands of type "executable program" (ls and /bin/ls).
Runs the following build-in commands: exit, env, setenv and unsetenv.
Handles commands with arguments.
Handles the PATH global variable.
Handles The EOF (End Of File) condition.
Handles the Ctrl + C signal -> It doesn't exit the shell
